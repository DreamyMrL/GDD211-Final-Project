    text: Miss Marin, unlike my associate I have no interest in making any unfounded
      accusations. You hired me to help and that's what I'm here to do. But I can't
      do that if I don't know what I'm working with. Please, tell me what you know
      about this man and let me do my job.

    text: Stealing. I noticed the register count in the gift shop always seemed to
      be a little off when he was closing. I let it slide for a little while but
      we just kept missing more and more and I had to do something about it eventually.
