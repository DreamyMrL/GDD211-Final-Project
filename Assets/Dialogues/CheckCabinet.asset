    text: First, Jacob's ability was a kind of invulnerability. The brief summary
      given in the file states that his skin could not be cut or severed. You understand
      that most abilities are more complicated than just that, and the information
      in an employee file likely would not cover the more...nuanced aspects of it.
      But, this certainly makes you wonder how his arm could've been severed.

      It seems that anything stolen by Mr. Mills was not recovered by the owner.
