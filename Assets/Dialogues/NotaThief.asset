      you find yourself squinting up at Miss Marin, who looks beyond tired of you.

      of all, you'll never guess his ability. It's a sort of invulnerability, the
      records were vague but it seems like his skin couldn't be cut or severed, so
      they had him working most of the dangerous jobs.

      up.
